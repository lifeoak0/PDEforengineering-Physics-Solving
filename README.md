3D propagation is a fundamental equation in physics and engineering, describing how waves propagate through a medium, solving the 3d wave equation typically requires the use of numerical especially for complex boundary conditions or domains one common approach is to use the finite difference method (FDM) for spatial discretization and then step forward in time.
Navier-stokes equations are partial differential equations describing the motion of viscous fluid substances such as liquids and gases. these equations are fundamental in the field of fluid dynamics. They are used to model weather ocean currents water flow in a pipe, the star's motion inside the galaxy, and airflow around a wing among other phenomena.
the 1d heat conduction equation also known as the one-dimensional Fourier heat conduction equation is a fundamental partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat or variation in temperature, in a given region over time, in the absence of any sources or sinks of heat,
